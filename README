#Quick start#

First of all, you need an administrator account. There is one:

    * Username: admin
    * Password: pass

You must change the password in the preferences page after logging
in. When you are logged in, an administration button will appear at
the top of the page. There you can add, edit or remove posts, moderate
comments and manage users.

Make sure that the directories permissions are OK, so DBLess can write
on them.

#Users#

New users can create an account in the join form. All users created
will be regular users and their accounts are needed only to make any
comments showing some identity (nickname).

#Creating an aministrator#

All administrators have the same privileges. This site was intented to
be a only-one-administrator site. To create a new administator you
need to create the user in the regular form, and then add his/her
username to the administrators names array in `conf/site_admin.php'.

#Languages#

The posts are saved on its own language folder, so if you add a new
post in English, the post will be saved in posts/en/ and will not be
able to be seen from another language. If you want to run this site in
more than one language you have to create a post for each language.

#Adding a new language to the site#

In order to add languages to the site so you can use it in a
multilingual mode, you need three things:

  * A language file stored in `langs/frontend/<language_code>/'

  * A language file stored in `langs/backend/<language_code>/'

  * A directory where to save the new incoming posts in
    `posts/<language_code>'

##Removing a language from the site##

If you want to remove a language from your site, it will be enough
removing the directory: `posts/<language_code>'. You don't need to
remove the language file in `langs/'. It can stay there for a future
use.

When you access to your site in a language, the interface language
will change too. If you enter in the administration in English, it's
the administration for the English posts only.
